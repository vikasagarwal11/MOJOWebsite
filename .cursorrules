# MOJO Website - Cursor Agent Rules

## Project Overview
This is a React/TypeScript fitness community website built with Vite, Firebase, and modern web technologies.

## Tech Stack
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Functions, Cloud Messaging)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- React Router for navigation
- Workbox for PWA functionality

## Architecture Principles
- Use Riverpod and hooks (flutter_riverpod, hooks_riverpod) with StreamProvider for real-time updates
- Follow clean architecture with reusable services, data models, and clean separation of business logic, UI, and state
- Use stateless widgets where possible and prefer final variables
- Modular design with reusable components

## Code Standards
- Use the logger package to log info, warnings, errors, and debug messages, integrated with Firebase Analytics/Crashlytics
- Avoid using print() statements
- Use Material 3 components with playful minimalism (1–2 buttons per screen, vibrant colors)
- Implement micro-interactions with Lottie animations and gamification elements
- Prioritize fast rendering and accessibility

## Firebase Integration
- Use Firebase Auth for authentication
- Use Firestore for database with soft delete columns (isDeleted, deletedAt, deletedBy)
- Use Firebase Storage for file uploads
- Use Firebase Cloud Messaging for notifications
- Use Firebase Cloud Functions for ephemeral Moments and challenge logic

## Firebase Storage Bucket Domain - CRITICAL RULE
- **NEVER use `.appspot.com` domain for Firebase Storage buckets**
- **ALWAYS use `.firebasestorage.app` domain for Firebase Storage buckets**
- The legacy `.appspot.com` domain does NOT support proper CORS and will cause CORS errors
- When normalizing storage bucket names, always convert `.appspot.com` → `.firebasestorage.app`
- The `normalizeStorageBucket` function in `src/config/firebase.ts` must always ensure `.firebasestorage.app` is used
- If you see `.appspot.com` in the code, it is a bug that must be fixed
- Production storage bucket format: `momsfitnessmojo-65d00.firebasestorage.app` (NOT `.appspot.com`)

## Environment File Handling
- **ALWAYS** reference the .env file when making environment-related changes
- The .env file contains the actual Firebase configuration for development
- Environment variables are prefixed with VITE_ for client-side access
- Never hardcode environment values - always use process.env.VITE_* variables
- When suggesting environment changes, always check what's currently in .env first

## UI/UX Guidelines
- Design advanced chat UI (sleek bubbles, swipe-to-reply, animated reactions, typing indicators)
- Create event UI (animated RSVP, confetti check-in, clean calendar)
- Use modern UI components with playful minimalism
- Implement micro-interactions and gamification
- Ensure responsive design and accessibility

## File Structure
- Components in src/components/ organized by feature
- Services in src/services/ for business logic
- Hooks in src/hooks/ for reusable logic
- Types in src/types/ for TypeScript definitions
- Utils in src/utils/ for helper functions

## Environment Configuration
- **CRITICAL**: Always check .env file before making environment-related changes
- The project uses .env as the development environment file (not .env.local)
- Current Firebase project: momfitnessmojo (development)
- Storage bucket: mojomediafiles (use `.firebasestorage.app` domain, NEVER `.appspot.com`)
- Functions region: us-central1
- Environment: development
- Use momsfitnessmojo@gmail.com for email communications
- Production storage bucket: `momsfitnessmojo-65d00.firebasestorage.app` (must use `.firebasestorage.app`, NOT `.appspot.com`)

## Database Rules
- Every table includes soft delete columns (isDeleted, deletedAt, deletedBy)
- Firebase project ID: momfitnessmojo
- Storage bucket: mojomediafiles

## Testing
- Write unit tests for services and utilities
- Test React components with React Testing Library
- Use Vitest for test runner

## Performance
- Optimize for fast rendering
- Use lazy loading where appropriate
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Monitor bundle size and performance metrics
